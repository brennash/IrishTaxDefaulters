## Data Download
This tool relies totally on the publicly accessible data from the Irish tax authorities web-site, 
and defaulters archive. The tool provides no guarantees for data correctness either in the input data
or after it has been parsed by the tool. This repo in itself does not hold any data, which must be 
downloaded separately.
